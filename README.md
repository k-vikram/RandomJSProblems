This is a collection of random JS Problems I faced in various Tests, Interviews, Puzzles, Sites, Hackathons etc. Idea is to make a repo of these for quick references in the future.

Will keep adding JS problems that will be solved randomly or any other snippet that are worth collecting here. Feel free to browse.

> Might be helpful for Interview Preaparation People or JS starters.

**Run Instructions**: Paste the script it into a dummy HTML file(encl.) with a script a tag and open that file with any modern Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari,Brave etc..)
